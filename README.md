# fillit
42 School Silicon Valley 3rd project and first group project.

A program that takes 4 given figures and places them in the map matrix in optimized way - closer to left-top corner.
It should first validate the given file and place the figures using backtracking recursion algorithm.

___________
Fillit is a project that let you discover and/or familiarize yourself with a recurring
problematic in programming: searching the optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities, in a respectable timing. 
In this particular project, you will have to find a way to
assemble a given Tetriminos set altogether in the smallest possible square.
A Tetriminos is a 4-blocks geometric figure you probably already heard of, thanks to
the popular game Tetris.

# Usage

git clone this repository

run `make` this will compile a program

`./fillit [map]` to execute the program, map given as a parameter
